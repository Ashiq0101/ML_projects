# ðŸŒŸ **CSE422 Project: Data Analysis and Visualization** ðŸ“Š  

Welcome to the **CSE422 Project** repository! This project is centered around analyzing datasets, extracting insights, and presenting findings through data visualization. It combines Python's powerful libraries to preprocess, clean, and visualize data effectively.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Overview**  

This project is designed to demonstrate how to work with real-world datasets by performing the following steps:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, inconsistent data types, and outliers.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use statistical summaries and visualizations to understand patterns in the data.  
- **Insights Extraction**: Derive actionable insights through data relationships and trends.  
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations that make data-driven conclusions accessible and understandable.  

**How It Works**:  
1. The project begins by loading the dataset into the Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Data cleaning is performed to prepare the data for analysis.  
3. Key statistics and relationships are explored using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.  
4. Visualizations are created to highlight patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.  
5. Results are summarized to draw meaningful conclusions.
